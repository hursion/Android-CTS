#Setting up CTS

##Physical environment
###Bluetooth LE beacons

If the DUT supports the Bluetooth LE feature, then at least three Bluetooth LE beacons should be placed within five meters of the DUT for Bluetooth LE scan testing. Those beacons can be any kind, do not need to be configured or emit anything specific, and can include iBeacon, Eddystone, or even devices simulating BLE beacons.
###Cameras

When running camera CTS, you are recommended to use normal lighting conditions with a test pattern chart (such as a checkerboard pattern) that is not too close to the lens (the distance depends on the device's minimum focus distance).

If the DUT supports external cameras, such as USB webcams, then an external camera must be plugged in when running CTS. Otherwise, the CTS tests will fail.
###GPS/GNSS

If the DUT supports the Global Positioning System (GPS) Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) feature, then a GPS/GNSS signal, with GPS portion compliant with ICD-GPS-200C, should be provided to the DUT at a suitable signal level for reception and GPS location calculation. The GPS/GNSS signal source can be of any kind, ranging from a satellite simulator, to a GPS/GNSS repeater of outdoor signals, simply to placement of the DUT close enough to a window such that it can directly receive enough GPS/GNSS signal.
Caution: For the GPS testing, the internet connection setup must not block connections to supl.google.com port 7276. This port is used to download GPS assistance data for testing position calculation on the local device.
###Wi-Fi and IPv6

CTS tests require a Wi-Fi network that supports IPv6, can treat the Device Under Test (DUT) as an isolated client, and has an internet connection. An isolated client refers to a configuration where the DUT does not have visibility to the broadcast/multinetwork messages on that subnetwork, either by a Wi-Fi AP configuration or by running the DUT on an isolated sub-network without other devices being connected.

If you don't have access to a native IPv6 network, an IPv6 carrier network, or a VPN to pass some tests depending on IPv6, you may instead use a Wi-Fi access point and an IPv6 tunnel. See Wikipedia list of IPv6 tunnel brokers.
###Wi-Fi RTT (Round Trip Time)

Android 9 adds an API for a Wi-Fi RTT capability, which allows devices to measure their distance to access points with an accuracy of 1 to 2 meters, thus increasing indoor location accuracy significantly. Here are two recommended devices supporting Wi-Fi RTT: Google Wifi and Compulab's Filet2 Access Point (set to 40MHz bandwidth at 5GHz).

The access points should be powered up, but not required to be connected to any network. Access points do not need to be next to the testing device; however, they are recommended to be within a distance of 40 ft from the DUT. One access point is typically sufficient.
##Desktop machine setup
Caution: CTS currently supports 64-bit Linux and Mac OS host machines. CTS will not work on Windows OS.
###ADB and AAPT

Before running the CTS, make sure you have recent versions of both Android Debug Bridge (adb) and Android Asset Packaging Tool (AAPT) installed and those tools' location added to the system path of your machine.

To install ADB, download the Android SDK Tools package for your operating system, open it, and follow the instructions in the included README file. For troubleshooting information, see Installing the Stand-alone SDK Tools.

Ensure adb and aapt are in your system path. The following command assumes you've opened the package archive in your home directory:

` export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/android-sdk-linux/build-tools/<version>`

Note: Please ensure your starting path and directory name are correct.
###Java Development Kit (JDK)

Install the proper version of the Java Development Kit (JDK). For Android 7.0â€”

    On Ubuntu, use OpenJDK 8.
    On Mac OS, use jdk 8u45 or newer.

For details, see the JDK requirements.
###CTS files

Download and open the CTS packages matching your devices' Android version and all the Application Binary Interfaces (ABIs) your devices support.

Download and open the latest version of the CTS Media Files.
###Device detection

Follow the step to set up your system to detect your device, such as creating a udev rules file for Ubuntu Linux.
##Android device setup
###User builds

A compatible device is defined as a device with a user/release-key signed build, so your device should be running a system image based on the known to be compatible user build (Android 4.0 and later) from Codenames, Tags, and Build Numbers.

Caution: When used to confirm Android compatibility of your final system image, CTS must be executed on devices with a user build.
###First API level build property

Certain CTS requirements depend on the build a device was originally shipped with. For example, devices that originally ship with earlier builds may be excluded from system requirements that apply to devices that ship with later builds.

To make this information available to CTS, device manufacturers may define the build-time property: ro.product.first_api_level. The value of this property is the first API level the device was commercially launched with.

OEMs can add PRODUCT_PROPERTY_OVERRIDES into their device.mk file to set this property, as shown in the following example:

`#ro.product.first_api_level indicates the first api level, device has been commercially launched on.
PRODUCT_PROPERTY_OVERRIDES +=\
ro.product.first_api_level=21
`

 Note: The property ro.product.first_api_level should be unset (removed) for the first build of a product, and set to the correct API level value for all subsequent builds. This way the property can correctly identify a new product, and we have lost no information about the first API level of the product. If the flag is unset, Android will assign Build.VERSION.SDK_INT to ro.product.first_api_level.
###CTS Shim apps

Android 7.0 includes the following pre-built apps (built from this source) which do not contain any code except for the manifest:

    frameworks/base/packages/CtsShim/CtsShim.apk
    This apk file is copied to /system/app/CtsShimPrebuilt.apk on the system image.
    frameworks/base/packages/CtsShim/CtsShimPriv.apk
    This apk file is copied to /system/priv-app/CtsShimPrivPrebuilt.apk on the system image.

CTS uses these apps to test privileges and permissions. To pass the tests, you must preload the apps into the appropriate directories on the system image without re-signing them.
###Sample Applet

Android 9 introduced Open Mobile API Test cases, which are used to check if the underlying implementation of Secure Elements are implemented as per standard. These test cases would require the installation of a special applet which can be used by the CTS application to communicate with. One can use the sample applet as provided.

This is applicable to devices, which have eSE(embedded Secure Element), SIM or SDs. See CTS Test for Secure Element for more detailed information on Open Mobile API Test cases and Access Control Test cases.
###Storage requirements

The CTS media stress tests require video clips to be on external storage (/sdcard). Most of the clips are from Big Buck Bunny which is copyrighted by the Blender Foundation under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

The required space depends on the maximum video playback resolution supported by the device (See section 5 in the compatibility definition document for the platform version of the required resolutions.) Note that the video playback capabilities of the device under test will be checked via the android.media.CamcorderProfile APIs for earlier versions of Android and the android.media.MediaCodecInfo.CodecCapabilities APIs from Android 5.0.

Here are the storage requirements by maximum video playback resolution:

    480x360: 98MB
    720x480: 193MB
    1280x720: 606MB
    1920x1080: 1863MB 

###Screen and storage

    Any device that does not have an embedded screen needs to be connected to a screen.
    If the device has a memory card slot, plug in an empty SD card. Use an SD card that supports Ultra High Speed (UHS) Bus with SDHC or SDXC capacity or one with at least speed class 10 or higher to ensure it can pass the CTS.

    Warning: CTS may modify/erase data on the SD card plugged into the device.
    If the device has SIM card slots, plug in an activated SIM card to each slot. If the device supports SMS, each SIM card should have its own number field populated.

###Developer UICC

In order to run CTS carrier API tests, the device needs to have a SIM card with carrier privilege rules on it. See Preparing the UICC.
##Android device configuration

   1.Factory data reset the device: Settings > Backup & reset > Factory data reset

    Warning: This will erase all user data from the device.
  
  2.Set your device's language to English (United States) from: Settings >  Language & input > Language
  
   3.Turn on the location setting if there is a GPS or Wi-Fi / Cellular network feature on the device: Settings > Location > On

    Note: This verify apps step became required in Android 4.2.
    
   11.Launch the browser and dismiss any startup/setup screen.
   
   12.Connect the desktop machine that will be used to test the device with a USB cable

    Note: When you connect a device running Android 4.2.2 or later to your computer, the system shows a dialog asking whether to accept an RSA key that allows debugging through this computer. Select Allow USB debugging.
   
   13.Install and configure helper apps on the device.

    Note: For CTS versions 2.1 R2 through 4.2 R4, set up your device (or emulator) to run the accessibility tests with:
    adb install -r android-cts/repository/testcases/CtsDelegatingAccessibilityService.apk
    On the device, enable: Settings > Accessibility > Accessibility > Delegating Accessibility Service

    Note: For CTS versions prior to 7.0, on devices that declare android.software.device_admin, set up your device to run the device administration test using:
    adb install -r android-cts/repository/testcases/CtsDeviceAdmin.apk

    In Settings > Security > Select device administrators, enable the two android.deviceadmin.cts.CtsDeviceAdminReceiver* device administrators. Ensure the android.deviceadmin.cts.CtsDeviceAdminDeactivatedReceiver and any other preloaded device administrators remain disabled.
    
   14.Copy the CTS media files to the device as follows:

    Note: For CTS 2.3 R12 and later, if the device supports video codecs, the CTS media files must be copied to the device.
        Navigate (cd) to the path the media files are downloaded and unzipped to.
        Change the file permissions: chmod u+x copy_media.sh
        Run copy_media.sh:
            To copy clips up to a resolution of 720x480, run: ./copy_media.sh 720x480
            If you are not sure about the maximum resolution, try ./copy_media.sh all so that all files are copied.
            If there are multiple devices under adb, add the -s (serial) option to the end. For example, to copy up to 720x480 to the device with serial 1234567, run: ./copy_media.sh 720x480 -s 1234567
